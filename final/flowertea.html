	<h1>What is Flower tea?</h1>
	<p>Many types of flowers have been traditionally used to scent tea leaves. Adding fresh flowers to already finished teas imparts a light and pleasant flavor.</p>
<p>“Blooming teas”, also known as “presentation teas” or known in China as “hui fa cha”,  have become popular in recent years for their beautiful display as well as exquisite flavor.  They were banned during the Cultural Revolution because they were considered wasteful and frivoluous.</p>
