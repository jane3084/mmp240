<h2>What is resume?</h2>  

<p>Resume is a document used and created by a person to present their background, skills, and accomplishments. Resumes can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often they are used to secure new employment.</p>



<p>A typical resume contains a "summary" of relevant job experience and education. The resume is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview.

<h2>What to include in your resume?</h2>
<p>At a minimum, your resume should include your contact information, work experience, and education. Additional sections for career summary, skills, volunteer work, and additional qualifications can be added if they are relevant to the job for which you are applying.</p>

<p>The operative work here is "relevant". Remember that your resume is meant to quickly highlight the reasons you are a great fit for the job. It is not meant to detail every job duty you have ever performed. Instead of simply writing your day-to-day responsibilities from past jobs, study the job listing and try to come up with an answer for each requirement listed.</p>
