	<h1>Have no idea of how to write a resume?</h1>
<h4>let's follow the below steps to finish your resume!</h4>
<h3> 1. CONTACT INFORMATION  </h3>
<ol>

	<li>Enter your first and last name in place of [Full Name]</li>
	<li>Enter the digits of the phone number you have decided to use in place of [###.###.####].</li>
<li>Replace [mailing address or City, ST]</li>
<li>Enter your email address in place of [email@emailprovider.com].</li>
<li>In our example, replace [LinkedIn URL or website address] with your personal website address if you have one</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ol>

	<h3>2.  WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>List jobs and accomplishments relevant to your job goal in the Work Experience section. Many employers want to see your work history, so if you have unrelated jobs that still fill in your work history, just include a brief description. </li>
	</ol>
		<h3>3. EDUCATION</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>The name of your school</li>
			<li>Location of your school</li>
			<li>The degree you obtained (if applicable)</li>
			<li>Your field of study</li>
			<li>Graduation year (if applicable)</li>
			<li>Your GPA (Note: You may not want to include this if it’s not above 3.4)</li>
			<li>Any relevant honors or academic recognition, coursework, activities or other achievements obtained during your education</li>

</ol>
		<h3>4. SKILL</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>When trying to figure out which skills to put on your resume, you need to focus on both hard and soft skills. A good list of soft skills will show you work well with others, whereas a solid hard skills list will prove you have the specific skills to do the job.</li>
				<li>Almost every job requires a mixture of the two to perform at peak levels.</li>
				<li>It’s important that you show the hiring manager you’re more than just a computer wizard or fast talker by including both types of abilities on your resume.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>5. AWARDS AND HONORS</h3>
			<ol><li>List your accomplishments, they are relevant honors, achievements or awards that you earned for exceeding average standards in either academics, athletics, or in a work environment</li></ol>

		<h3>6. VOLUNTEER WORK AND AFFILIATIONS</h3>
			<ol><li>Related volunteer work can be combined with related work experience under a category heading like "Related Experience." If the volunteer work demonstrates a critical skill area, then it could be placed within a category with a functional heading like "Fundraising Experience" or "Event Planning Experience." </li></ol>
